= Introduction =

Some manufacturer rewrite the libmedia libcutils or libutils. If this is the case, specific binaries for the manufacturer will be needed.

To allow us to make a custom compilation for this kind of hardware, there is now a simple way to contribute and help us.

= How to report your libs for your unsupported hardware=

 * [http://csipsimple.googlecode.com/files/MediaLibGet.apk Download the apk here].

 * Install it

 * Run it and choose send mail (use your favorite mail account). Then just click on send.

Once the lib will be compiled, you'll be notified that a new build for your hardware is available. If you don't want to be contacted for beta-testing the new build for your device, let us know in the body of the mail (before information on your android and hardware version).
