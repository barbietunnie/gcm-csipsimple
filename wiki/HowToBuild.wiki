= Introduction =


Create a new directory for the project.

= Build the pjsip library for android =

I have not committed into the svn the compiler, linker etc for android. So you'll have to get them from the official ndk and then to include them into the project.

 * First of all get the ndk and unzip
{{{
wget http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r3-linux-x86.zip
unzip android-ndk-r3-linux-x86.zip
rm android-ndk-r3-linux-x86.zip
}}}

 * Then checkout the pjsip part of the project :
{{{
svn checkout http://csipsimple.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pjsip_android pjsip_android
}}}

 * Now we have to add the ndk toolchains into the pjsip_android project ndk.
{{{
cp -r android-ndk-r3/build/prebuilt pjsip_android/build/
}}}
_ Note : You can now delete the android-ndk-r3 folder _


 * Go into the pjsip_android directory and initialize the ndk:
{{{
cd pjsip_android
./build/host-setup.sh
}}}

 * And now you have two options.
   * Launch a make (but it will generate only one target lib)
{{{
make APP=pjsip APP_PLATFORM=android-4
}}}
     _(you can replace android-4 by the target you want to build for)_
   * Launch a shell script I wrote that will automatically make all targets for you.
{{{
./build_release.sh
}}}

Congratulation you've just build the dynamic library.
You can find your build under 
{{{
apps/pjsip/project/libs/armeabi/android-4
}}}

_* Note :* You can list currently available target using : _
{{{
ls build/platforms/
}}}
