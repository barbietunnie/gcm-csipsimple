= Is there a way to close the application? =
Yes, but you have to configure CSipSimple according to the fact you want to be able to close it !

Let me explain : CSipSimple can run under several setting configuration :
 * "Always available" when you want to be able to receive calls
 * "Only for outgoing calls" when you only want to use sip for outgoing calls (CSipSimple starts when you dial from native dialer or when you launch the application).

When you set "Always available", close option make no sense : indeed, the application will automatically restart when network will change of state... and you'll say me "Hey there's a bug... the app constantly restart itself". By using this profile you tell the software that you want to receive your calls, and it will do it's best to be running when you can receive calls.

However, if you choose "Only for outgoing"... Close option will appear in the menu of CSipSimple dialer! Since here, it make sense to use this option, since the app will never restart itself.

= When integrated to android, I don't want some number to be handled by SIP =
= I want to automatically add prefix/rewrite some numbers = 
There is a powerful rewriting/filter/auto-answer tool in CSipSimple.
To access this tool, go on the account on which you want to apply things. Press menu button and choose "Filters".
You are now in the tool. Using this tool you can :
 * Rewrite numbers : for example add prefix, suffix, completely replace the number by another one, or apply a custom regexp - if you don't know what a regexp is, don't use it ;).
 * Don't call some numbers : if you don't want some number to be managed by this account, for example call to other mobiles phone etc, you can add an exclude rule. Then when you'll dial *from native dialer/contact app* if the phone number match this rule, this sip account will not be proposed in the list of choices you have and if there is no SIP account that can handle this number, it will automatically use Mobile without asking you anything
 * Force call some numbers using this account : same thing that the last point, but here it will not exclude, but force the call to use this account and will not ask you for anything.
 * Auto answer : if you want to automatically answer to some phone number, you can add a rule here. It's useful if you are using some call callback feature from your provider.

= The other party can hear me but I can not hear them =
It's probably a NAT problem. Some networks are NATed network. It means that there is some network equipment between you and the rest of the world that "hide" your IP address to the rest and the world. It results that your SIP client will not announce properly your IP to sip server and other party. So when a call is placed and media stream is established, the remote party doesn't know where to send its stream and you can't hear him.
To solve this problem there is some techniques in SIP :
Go on setting Settings > Network - Tick "Use Stun" and fill a stun server on the field bellow. You can use whatever stun server you want it's not necessarily linked to your provider. See http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/STUN Public Stun server section to know what server you could use freely. 
You can also try to use ICE, but most of the time STUN solve the problem.

If it doesn't help, there is maybe a problem with your device (on some device, manufacturers does strange things with the android audio stack). So report the problem on the issue section.
